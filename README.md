Repository journal for introduction to Python

# About me
Hi, I'm Trevor. I usually go by glycin8 online. I like to have control over computers, rather than them have control over me.

# Goals for this course
I want to at least have a solid understanding of the basics of Python, that hopefully inspires me to go more in depth in my own time. In my experience, doing random stuff on the side is the best way to learn.

# My First Python Program (sort of!)
print("hello world")
